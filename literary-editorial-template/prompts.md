# Literary Editorial Prompts

Use these prompts to generate content that fits the "Neo-Brutalism / Literary" aesthetic.

## For Dashboard Content
"Generate short, evocative titles for the dashboard widgets. Instead of 'Device Count', use something like 'Inventory Status' or 'Current Holdings'. Keep descriptions poetic but clear."

## For Empty States
"Write an empty state message for the device list that sounds professional yet warm. Avoid robotic 'No data found'. Try 'The ledger is currently empty. Begin by adding a new record.'"

## For Button Labels
"Use imperative, strong verbs. 'Register', 'Archive', 'Explore'."
